       Here, you find a Makefile "adjoint_ecco" that allows
       you to put all the code togther that has to be seen 
       by TAMC in order to produce adjoint code.

       The sed script "adjoint_ecco_sed.com" allows you to
       do some postprocessing of the adjoint code. It inserts
       addtional arguments to the TAMC-generated calls to
       "adread", "adwrite", "adopen", and "adclose".

       Please have look at the options you have in "adjoint_ecco"
       and how they work.

       --> adcode
       --> admodel
       --> adall

       --> adchange
       --> adrestore

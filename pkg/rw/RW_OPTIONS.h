C CPP options file for RW package

C Use this file for selecting options within the RW package

#ifndef RW_OPTIONS_H
#define RW_OPTIONS_H
#include "PACKAGES_CONFIG.h"
#ifdef ALLOW_RW

#include "CPP_OPTIONS.h"

C use READ_MFLDS S/R in "safe" mode (set/check/unset for each file to read)
C involves more thread synchronization (could slow down multi-threaded run)
#define RW_SAFE_MFLDS

C disable writing of small-overlap size array (to reduce memory size 
C   since those S/R do a local copy to 3-D full-size overlap array)
#undef RW_DISABLE_SMALL_OVERLAP

#endif /* ALLOW_RW */

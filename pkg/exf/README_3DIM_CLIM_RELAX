3-dim. relaxation with exf
--------------------------
24-Nov-2005 heimbach@mit.edu

A term 
   1/tau*( theta(i,j,k) - thetaStar(i,j,k) ) 
will be added in S/R EXTERNAL_FORCING_T
(file external_forcing.F)

o At compile time, in "ECCO_CPPOPTIONS.h" set
#define  ALLOW_CLIMTEMP_RELAXATION
#define  ALLOW_CLIMSALT_RELAXATION

o At runtime, in "data", under &PARM03 set (e.g., units are seconds)
 tauThetaClimRelax3Dim = 15552000.0,
 tauSaltClimRelax3Dim  = 15552000.0,

3 cases:
-------
1) Use a constant-in-time 3-dim. field
2) Provide 12 3-dim. fields corresponding to Jan., ... , Dec.
3) Real-time relax. to time-evolving prescribed field

ad 1)
-----
thetaStar will be defined once only in ini_forcing.F
o File names hydrogThetaFile, hydrogSaltFile in 
  "data" under PARM05 are used.
o Do leave strings climtempfile, climsaltfile in "data.exf_clim" empty

ad 2)
fields defined by names climtempfile, climsaltfile in "data.exf_clim"
will be assumed to have 12 records
o in "data.exf_clim" define strings climtempfile, climsaltfile 
o in "data.exf_clim" set climtempperiod = 0., climsaltperiod = 0.
o other startdate/period parameters will be ignored

ad 3)
-----
o in "data.exf_clim" define strings climtempfile, climsaltfile 
o in "data.exf_clim" set climstartdate, climtempperiod, etc.
  to corresponding times, and interval/period between two records

N.B.)
-----
If you'd like a constant in time relaxation field different
to the one provided by hydrogThetaFile, hydrogSaltFile,
as a workaround (if not too big files)
generate a file climtempperiod, climsaltperiod
with 12 times identical record, and follow route 2)

Package ``FRAZIL'' is a repackaging and a replacement for subroutine
interior_freeze.F and for run-time option allowInteriorFreezing, which has
been retired.  It is meant to represent the formation of frazil at depth due
to pressure and freshening-related supercooling.

The initial functionality of pkg/frazil is similar to that previously provided
by interior_freeze.F, that is, it checks for water below the freezing point at
depth and brings the negative heat anomaly to the surface level.
Specifically, pkg/frazil currently assumes that: (i) supercooling at depth
creates frazil, which rises to the model's surface level in one model time
step, and (ii) the frazil is porous to salinity as it rises through the water
column, that is, frazil does not generate or transport salt anomalies.

The difference with interior_freeze.F is that rather than directly change
potential temperature THETA, pkg/frazil instead stores the required
adjustments in a frazil temperature forcing matrix:
FrazilForcingT (> 0 increases theta [W/m^2]).

The frazil forcing terms are computed prior to any of the ``ice'' packages and
routines (seaice, thsice, shelfice, icefront, and freeze_surface).  This
allows the ice packages to operate on FrazilForcingT, if they need to do so,
prior to applying this FrazilForcingT to THETA in external_forcing.F

Package frazil is enabled with CPP option ALLOW_FRAZIL and runtime parameter
useFRAZIL, in the usual MITgcm ways.  There are currently no pkg/frazil
runtime options, so there is no need for data.frazil runtime option file.

Package ``FRAZIL'' is:

What happens when you have supercooled water in the middle of the water
column?  Need to generate frazil ice, that floats to the surface (salinity and
heat source locally plus adds ice to the sea ice and removes water from water
column).

Packaging of interior_freeze.  There's many reasons for that, including the
addition of diagnostics and the potential for a more realistic description of
frazil ice formation and redistribution processes at depth.

Initially pkg/frazil will only do what interior_freeze does now, i.e., collect
negative heat below the freezing point at depth and immediately bring it to
the surface.  Temperatures below the freezing point at depth will be adjusted
to the freezing point.  A 2D array containing negative heat in "W/m^2" will be
generated, which will be passed first to the sea-ice and shelf-ice packages.
Any residual heat after the "ice" packages are done will be added to Qnet.

It is assumed that frazil ice is porous to salt and immediately adjusts to
ambient salinity so that it does not carry any salt as it rises through water
column.

??? Should pkg/frazil collect negative heat from the surface level,
??? from the level immediately below ice shelves,
??? or from grid boxes adjacent to ice fronts?

3. I will generate 2 separate diagnostics:
  a 3-D diagnostic that contains pkg/frazil temperature adjustments divided by dTtracerLev(k) in deg C / s,
  and a 2-D diagnostic that contains the negative heat passed to the ice packages in Joules.

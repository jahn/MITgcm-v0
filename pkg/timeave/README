This package contains 2 different types of routines for making "Time 
Average Diagnostics":

o Low-level routines (timeave_cum* , timeave_norm* and timeave_reset*)
  that can easily be used for any kind of variables (see for instance 
  gmredi package).
o High-level routines (timeave_statv*) and Header file TIMEAVE_STATV.h
  that are dedicated to the model main state-variables and call the 
  low-level `timeave' routines. 
  Including additional auxiliary variables to those High-Level routines
  is not recommended.

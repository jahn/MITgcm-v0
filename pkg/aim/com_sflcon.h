C--
C--   /SFLCON/: Constants for surface fluxes (initial. in INPHYS)
C--    FWIND0 = ratio of near-sfc wind to lowest-level wind
C--    FTEMP0 = weight for near-sfc temperature extrapolation (0-1) :
C--             1 : linear extrapolation from two lowest levels
C--             0 : constant potential temperature ( = lowest level)
C--    FHUM0  = weight for near-sfc specific humidity extrapolation (0-1) :
C--             1 : extrap. with constant relative hum. ( = lowest level)
C--             0 : constant specific hum. ( = lowest level)
C--    CDL    = drag coefficient for momentum over land
C--    CDS    = drag coefficient for momentum over sea
C--    CHL    = heat exchange coefficient over land
C--    CHS    = heat exchange coefficient over sea
C--    VGUST  = wind speed for sub-grid-scale gusts
C--    SWMAX  = Soil wetness (in mm) corresp. to potential evapotranspiration

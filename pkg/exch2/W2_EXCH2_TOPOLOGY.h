C     !DESCRIPTION:
C     *==========================================================*
C     | W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h
C     | o Header defining tile exchange and mapping for W2_EXCH2
C     *==========================================================*
C     | 1rst part holds the full topology structure (same for all
C     |  process) and is independent of tile-processor repartition
C     |  (needs W2_EXCH2_SIZE.h to be included before)
C     | 2nd part (put in this header for convienience) holds
C     |   Tile Ids and is function of tile-process repartition
C     |  (needs SIZE.h to be included before)

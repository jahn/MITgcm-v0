C     *==========================================================*
C     | SUBROUTINE EXCH2_S3D_RX
C     | o Handle Simple exchanges (= that ignore corners)
C     |   for _RX, 3-dim scalar arrays with overlap size = 1
C     *==========================================================*
C     | Invoke appropriate exchange routine depending on type
C     | of grid (cube or globally indexed) to be operated on.

C     exchWidth[XY]  :: Extent of regions that will be exchanged.

C     ** NOTE ** The exchange routine we use here does not
C                require the preceeding and following barriers.
C                However, the slow, simple exchange interface
C                that is calling it here is meant to ensure
C                that threads are synchronised before exchanges
C                begine.

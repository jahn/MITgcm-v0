Using NonLin-FrSurf with OBCs:
----------------------------- 
In addition to values of uVel,vVel, T and S at the OB, you need to
specify also the values of eta at the OB (done in S/R OBCS_CALC).
 
The OB-eta values are primary defined at the boundaries (u point
for E/W  OBC ; v point for N/S OBC) and not at the cell center.
They are directly used to compute hFacW and hFacS at the boundaries
(no space average or min/max). This enable us to control exactly
the inflow / outflow at the OB (i.e. the product hFacW*uVel or hFacS*vVel).
 
The same OB-eta values are also applied to the etaH field (cell center
next to the boundaries) to update consistently hFacZ (e.g.: used in
horizontal viscous term). This secondary "obc_apply" has no effect
on volume and tracer flux through the OB.
 
NB: Orlanski radiative OBC not yet implemented for NonLin-FrSurf terms. 

Using ALLOW_OBCS_PRESCRIBE
--------------------------
This flag enables code to prescribe / read in time-dependent
open boundary conditions.
It is meant to be used in conjunction with the exf/ & cal/ package.
File names for open boundary conditions are set in data.obcs
starttime and period of open boundary records are set in data.exf.
To have input fields cyclic, parameter repeatperiod is set
to the cycling period (in seconds).
A set of example parameter files is in the MITgcm_contrib area under 
heimbach/obcs_prescribe/

Using ALLOW_OBCS_SPONGE
-----------------------
Sponge layer thickness and timescale (in days) is set in data.obcs.
A set of example parameter files is in the MITgcm_contrib area under 
heimbach/obcs_prescribe/

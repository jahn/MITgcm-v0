C     | These directives are for standard adjoint code           |
C     | generation (vector Jacobian product).                    |

C     | written and tested by Ralf Giering, Jan. 14th 1999       |
C     | added new S/R's for _xz_ , _yz_ heimbach@mit.edu May-01  |
C     | extended to tangent linear code heimbach@mit.edu Jan-02  |
C     |==========================================================|
C     | SUBROUTINE EXCH_*_R* is linear                           |
C     | only the array argument is active                        |
C     | only myThid is required for the adjoint subroutine       |

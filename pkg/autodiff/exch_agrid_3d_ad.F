C     *==========================================================*
C     | These routines essentially are calling the original
C     | routines in reverse mode.
C     | These are regular adjoint routines with no innermost
C     | dimension added.
C     | Calls to these routines will be generated automatically
C     | by TAMC if correct flow directives are given
C     |   tamc -reverse ....
C     |
C     | written and tested by Ralf Giering, Jan. 14th 1999

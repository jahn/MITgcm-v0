C     surfaceTendencyTice
C            - Temperature tendency in the top level due to the
C              melting or freezing of sea-ice.
C              Note that the surface level temperature is modified
C              directly by the sea-ice model in order to maintain
C              water temperature under sea-ice at the freezing
C              point.  But we need to keep track of the
C              equivalent amount of heat that this surface-level
C              temperature change implies because it is used by
C              the KPP package (kpp_calc.F and kpp_transport_t.F).
C              Units are degrees-C/s (>0 for ocean warming).

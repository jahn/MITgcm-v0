#  This was tested with gcc-gfortran v4.0.0 as shipped in Fedora Core
#  4-test-2.  MITgcm successfully compiled but the gfortran-built
#  mitgcmuv binary failed to read the "eedata" file.  The gfortran
#  docs make it clear that there are known NAMELIST bugs in curreent
#  versions of gfortran and that users should turn to g77 if their
#  code encounters these bugs.  Later versions of gfortran will
#  supposedly fix the NAMELIST implementation.

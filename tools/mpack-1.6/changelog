mpack (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, incorporating a number of Debian patches.
  * Forward ported Debian patches:
      - /usr/tmp to /var/tmp
      - unixpk.c: Don't declare extern int errno
  * munpack: Mention -t in usage info.  Closes: #182825, reported by
    Dan Jacobson.
  * Minor changes to function prototypes to fix the more alarming warnings.
  * Invoke configure instead of just make, now that upstream uses autoconf.
  * debian/rules: clean now deletes some autoconf junk.
  * debian/rules: update DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS support to noopt and nostrip.
  * debian/control: Recommend uudeview instead.
  * Dropped postinst and prerm, since /usr/doc symlinks are no longer needed.
  * debian/control: Update to standards version 3.6.0.

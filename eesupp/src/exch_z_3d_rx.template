C     | o Handle exchanges for _RX, 3-dim, zeta coord arrays.

C     | Branch to appropriate exchange routine for a zeta coord
C     | array on the current grid scheme.

C               apply.

C     myThid :: My thread id.

C                that is calling it here is meant to ensure
C                that threads are synchronised before exchanges
C                begine.

C     *==========================================================*
C     | SUBROUTINE EXCH_Z_3D_RX
C     | o Handle exchanges for _RX, 3-dim, zeta coord arrays.
C     *==========================================================*
C     | Branch to appropriate exchange routine for a zeta coord
C     | array on the current grid scheme.

C     == Routine arguments ==
C     phi    :: Array with overlap regions are to be exchanged
C               Note - The interface to EXCH_RX assumes that
C               the standard Fortran 77 sequence association rules
C               apply.
C     myNz   :: 3rd dimension of array to exchange
C     myThid :: My thread id.
      INTEGER myNz
      _RX phi(1-OLx:sNx+OLx,1-OLy:sNy+OLy,myNz,nSx,nSy)
      INTEGER myThid

C     !LOCAL VARIABLES:
C     == Local variables ==
C     OL[wens]       :: Overlap extents in west, east, north, south.
C     exchWidth[XY]  :: Extent of regions that will be exchanged.
      INTEGER OLw, OLe, OLn, OLs, exchWidthX, exchWidthY

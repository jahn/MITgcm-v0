C     *==========================================================*
C     | SUBROUTINE EXCH_UV_XYZ_RX                                 
C     | o Handle exchanges for _RX, 3-dimensional vector arrays.    
C     *==========================================================*
C     | Vector arrays need to be rotated and interchaged for 
C     | exchange operations on some grids. This driver routine
C     | branches to support this.

C     === Routine arguments ===
C     phi    :: Array with overlap regions are to be exchanged
C               Note - The interface to EXCH_RL assumes that
C               the standard Fortran 77 sequence association rules
C               apply.
C     myThid :: My thread id.
      _RX Uphi(1-OLx:sNx+OLx,1-OLy:sNy+OLy,Nr,nSx,nSy)
      _RX Vphi(1-OLx:sNx+OLx,1-OLy:sNy+OLy,Nr,nSx,nSy)
      LOGICAL withSigns
      INTEGER myThid

C     !LOCAL VARIABLES:
C     == Local variables ==
C     OL[wens]       :: Overlap extents in west, east, north, south.
C     exchWidth[XY]  :: Extent of regions that will be exchanged.
      INTEGER OLw, OLe, OLn, OLs, exchWidthX, exchWidthY, myNz

CEOP

      OLw        = OLx

C     ** NOTE ** The exchange routine we use here does not
C                require the preceeding and following barriers.
C                However, the slow, simple exchange interface
C                that is calling it here is meant to ensure
C                that threads are synchronised before exchanges
C                begine.

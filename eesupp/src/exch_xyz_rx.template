C     | SUBROUTINE EXCH_XYZ_RX                                   |
C     | o Handle exchanges for _RX   , three-dimensional arrays. |
C     |==========================================================|
C     | Do true shared-memory data transfers and "messaging"     |
C     | tranfers for blocking case of data transfers.            |
C     | Applications call this routine using                     |
C     |  CALL EXCH..( x, myThid )                                |
C     | where x is a three-dimensional array with overlaps.      |
C     | This routine does true-shared-memory copies for blocks   |
C     | within a thread. It will also do MPI meesaging between   |
C     | different processes.                                     |
C     | Note:                                                    |
C     | =====                                                    |
C     | If it is used, "asynchronous" messaging in which         |
C     | communication overlaps computation is handled elsewhere  |
C     | - see recv.F and send.F.                                 |
C     | In practice MPI implementations may not be completely    |
C     | thread safe. In principle this code is correct even for  |
C     | mixed MPI and multi-threaded execution.                  |
C     | In multi-thread execution data managed by other threads  |
C     | is only automatically visible to another thread if it    |
C     | existed before the thread was created. This means that   |
C     | for Fortran we declare arrays with overlap regions in    |
C     | COMMON blocks.                                           |

C                that is calling it here is meant to ensure

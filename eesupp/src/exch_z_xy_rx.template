C     | SUBROUTINE EXCH_Z_XY_RX                                  |
C     | o Handle exchanges for _RX,      2-dimensional arrays.   |
C     |==========================================================|
C     | Do true shared-memory data transfers and "messaging"     |
C     | tranfers for blocking case of data transfers.            |
C     | Applications call this routine using                     |
C     |  CALL EXCH..( x, myThid )                                |
C     | where x is a two-dimensional array with overlaps.        |
C     | This routine does true-shared-memory copies for blocks   |
C     | within a thread. It will also do MPI meesaging between   |
C     | different processes.                                     |
C     | Note:                                                    |
C     | =====                                                    |
C     | This routine is a default mode interface to the more     |
C     | general exchange routine. Under default mode the         |
C     | exchange is for an edge width of OLx, and OLy and        |
C     | updates corner points as well as edges ( slightly more   |
C     | synchronisation required).                               |

C                However, the slow, simple exchange interface
C                that is calling it here is meant to ensure
C                that threads are synchronised before exchanges
C                begine.

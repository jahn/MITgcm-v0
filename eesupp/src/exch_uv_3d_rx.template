C     !DESCRIPTION:
C     *==========================================================*
C     | SUBROUTINE EXCH_UV_3D_RX
C     | o Handle exchanges for _RX, 3-dimensional vector arrays.
C     *==========================================================*
C     | Vector arrays need to be rotated and interchaged for
C     | exchange operations on some grids. This driver routine
C     | branches to support this.
C     *==========================================================*

C     phi    :: Array with overlap regions are to be exchanged
C               Note - The interface to EXCH_RX assumes that
C               the standard Fortran 77 sequence association rules
C               apply.

C     myThid :: My thread id.
      INTEGER myNz

      LOGICAL withSigns

C                that is calling it here is meant to ensure

C                begine.

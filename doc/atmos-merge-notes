Notes for the merging of AJA's and JMC's atmospheric codes into
main-stream code:

branch-atmos-merge		Created branch
branch-atmos-merge-start	Initial state (equiv. to checkpoint33)
branch-atmos-merge-phase1	Phase 1: moved correction step from
                                top of dynamics() to end of the_main_loop()

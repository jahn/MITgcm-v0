Some redundancies and relations for model diagnostics:

1) Qnet = QNETtave = - oceQnet = SIqnet
   for open-ocean: Qnet = EXFqnet = SIqneto

2) EXFqnet = EXFlwnet + EXFswnet - EXFhl - EXFhs

3) Qsw = QSWtave = - oceQsw = SIqsw
   for open-ocean: Qsw = EXFswnet

4) EmPmR = EmPmRtave = -oceFWflx = SIempmr

Nov 19, 2006 (after tag checkpoint58r_post)

I) Some diagnostics have been renamed (essentially, to better
match the content):

1) name:	description (oceanic set-up):
PRESSURE	Cell-Center Height
replaced by:
RCENTER		Cell-Center Height

2) name:	description (oceanic set-up):
TICE		heat from melt/freeze of sea-ice, >0 increases theta
replaced by:
oceFreez	heating from freezing of sea-water (allowFreezing=T)

3) name:	description (oceanic set-up):
TAUX		zonal surface wind stress, >0 increases uVel
TAUY		meridional surf. wind stress, >0 increases vVel
replaced by:
oceTAUX		zonal surface wind stress, >0 increases uVel
oceTAUY		meridional surf. wind stress, >0 increases vVel

4) name:	description (oceanic set-up):
SWFLUX		net upward SW radiation, >0 increases theta
replaced by:
oceQsw		net Short-Wave radiation (+=down), >0 increases theta

5) name:	description (oceanic set-up):
DIFx_TH		Zonal      Diffusive Flux of Pot.Temperature
DIFy_TH		Meridional Diffusive Flux of Pot.Temperature
replaced by:
DFxE_TH		Zonal      Diffusive Flux of Pot.Temperature
DFyE_TH		Meridional Diffusive Flux of Pot.Temperature

6) name:	description (oceanic set-up):
DIFx_SLT	Zonal      Diffusive Flux of Salinity
DIFy_SLT	Meridional Diffusive Flux of Salinity
replaced by:
DFxE_SLT	Zonal      Diffusive Flux of Salinity
DFyE_SLT	Meridional Diffusive Flux of Salinity

-----------------------------------------------
II) Change description of existing diagnostics:

name:		old description (oceanic set-up):
TFLUX   	net surface heat flux, >0 increases theta
SFLUX   	net surface salt flux, >0 increases salt
name:		new description (oceanic set-up):
TFLUX   	total heat flux (match heat-content variations), >0 increases theta
SFLUX   	total salt flux (match salt-content variations), >0 increases salt

-----------------------------------------------
III) New diagnostics have been added:

name:		description (oceanic set-up):
atmPload	Atmospheric pressure loading
sIceLoad 	sea-ice loading (in Mass of ice+snow / area unit)
oceQnet		net surface heat flux into the ocean (+=down), >0 increases theta
oceFWflx	net surface Fresh-Water flux into the ocean (+=down), >0 decreases salinity
oceSflux 	net surface Salt flux into the ocean (+=down), >0 increases salinity
surForcT	model surface forcing for Temperature, >0 increases theta
surForcS	model surface forcing for Salinity, >0 increases salinity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relation between surForcT,surForcS and others surface forcing diagnostics:
 [x] = average of model variable "x" over the diagnostic time interval

a) if useRealFreshWaterFlux=F or (nonlinFreeSurf=0 & usingZCoords=T)
 surForcT = oceQnet  + TRELAX - oceQsw
 surForcS = oceSflux + SRELAX - [PmEpR*So]
  (with So = local Sea-Surface Salinity (SSS) if convertFW2Salt=-1
    and So = convertFW2Salt otherwise)
 oceFWflx = [PmEpR]
 TFLUX = surForcT + oceQsw + oceFreez
 SFLUX = surForcS

b) if useRealFreshWaterFlux=T & (nonlinFreeSurf>0 or usingPCoords=T),
In general:
 surForcT = oceQnet  + TRELAX - oceQsw + [T_dilution_effect]*Cp
 surForcS = oceSflux + SRELAX          + [S_dilution_effect]
    where T_dilution_effect = PmEpR*( temp_EvPrRn - SST )
      and S_dilution_effect = PmEpR*( salt_EvPrRn - SSS )
 oceFWflx = [PmEpR]
 TFLUX = surForcT + oceQsw + oceFreez + [PmEpR*SST]*Cp
 SFLUX = surForcS + [PmEpR*SSS]

And with the default value: salt_EvPrRn=0. & temp_EvPrRn=UNSET_RL
 (=> no dilution effect on Temp.):
 surForcT = oceQnet  + TRELAX - oceQsw
 surForcS = oceSflux + SRELAX - [PmEpR*SSS]

Notes:
1) here PmEpR is assumed to be the fresh-water mass flux
 per surface area [units: kg/m^2/s] whereas the model variable
 EmPmR is still a volume flux per surface area [units: m/s].
2) with Linear Free surface (nonlinFreeSurf=0), the term
corresponding to w_surface*SST,SSS is missing in TFLUX,SFLUX
[might be added later ?] to match exactly the Heat and Salt
budget evolution.

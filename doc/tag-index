    Notes on tags used in MITgcmUV
    ==============================

checkpoint36
 o implement Crank-Nirotropic time-stepping
 o recover Time-Average diagnostics
 o fix Pb in checkpoint (PR#19) 
 o AIM become a standard package ; clean unused CPP_kees

checkpoint35
 o subtantial rewrite of dynamics.f
 o allows staggered time-stepping
 o packaged obcs, aim (Atmospheric Physics), zonal_filt, shap_filt
 o added bottom drag (linear + quadratic)

checkpoint34
 o Modified exchange routines for correct reverse simulation.
 o Added verification output to comply with bug fix in impldiff.F
   as of c33 (exp2, natl_box).
 o Corrected store directives in dynamics.F
 o Corrected array boundaries in impldiff.F
 o Corrected array dimensions in gmredi.
   Added temporary scalars to avoid storage by TAMC (gmredi, kpp).
 o Added routine GLOBAL_SUM_INT to global_sum.F
 o Added mdsio_gl.F for ECCO purposes.

checkpoint33
 o Fixed bug in lower BC in impldiff.F
 o Fixed confusion about units of forcing arrays in FFIELDS.h
   namely Fu,Fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR:
   - Removed verification/natl_box/code/external_fields_scale.F
     (did not differ from that in model/src)
   - Changed units of fu,fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR back to proper units
     (see FFIELDS.h for description)
   - Scale fu,fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR when used in external_forcing_surf.F,
     kpp_calc.F and kpp_transport_t.F
   - Removed model/src/external_fields_scale.F and calls to it
   - verification/natl_box uses flux data with "atmospheric" sign so
     a special version of external_fields_load.F is used to
     change the data as it's read in. This way, the arrays
     have the right units and signs at all times tha a user could
     possibly use them.
 o Corrected genmake to delete a temporary file during configuration

checkpoint32
 o Scaling of forcing fields moved from external_forcing.F to
   external_fields_scale.F, called directly after loading fields.
 o Surface relaxation terms added to surface tendency fields in
   extra subroutine.
 o impldiff.F changed to avoid storing by TAMC of huge intermediate
   fields.
 o Changes in GMRedi to comply with packaging structure.
 o Modifications and bug fixes in KPP package.
 o Verification experiment for KPP added (verification/nat_box/)

checkpoint31
 o Packages interface brought in line with defined standard
   -> new routines packages_...F
   -> changes in initialise_fixed.F, initialise_varia.F
   -> enables initialisation interface for ECCO package
 o Rescaling of external forcing fields immediately after read
   (removed from external_forcing.F) 
   -> new: surface_fields_scale.F
   -> affects ini_foorcing.F, external_fields_load.F
 o Computation of surface tendencies before tendency updates.
   -> new: external_forcing_surf.F
 o Change of variable names useGMRedi, useKPP, useECCO
 o Further changes in dynamics.F, impldiff.F for TAMC
 o Tested for experiments 0, 2, 4.
   - not yet tested for GMRedi.
   - not yet tested for KPP.

checkpoint30
 o Updates for OBCs
 o New experiment for test OBCs (internal_wave)
 o New output.txt in verification/exp4/results/
 o Updates for KPP: calculation of viscosity corrected, new variables
   kpp_dumpFreq and kpp_taveFreq
 o CPP'd calls to system routines for TARGET_CRAY_VECTOR (P.H.)
   and entry for T90 in genmake

checkpoint29
 o packaged KPP and GM/Redi

checkpoint28
 o Corrected initialization of hFacMin for difference vertical coordinates
 o Modified calculation of partial cell thickness to more robust algorithm
 o config_summary.F: replaced write_1D_... by write_0D_...
   read_write.F: added subroutines write_0D_...
 o routines calc_common_factors, calc_gs, calc_gt, calc_phi_hyd, find_rho:
   included some initialisations required for TAMC.
 o routine calc_isoslopes: modified sqrt computation to make it 
   differentiable for zero argument.
 o routines dynamics, impldiff:
   included store directives and tape key computations required for TAMC.
 o ALL TAMC related changes are between ifdef ALLOW_AUTODIFF_TAMC

checkpoint27
 o fixed calc_isoslopes() to so that cancellation of terms in tensor
   formulation works properly with variable resolution.
 o restructured the calling tree between the_model_main() and dynamics()
 o split initialise() into initialise_fixed() and initialise_varia()
 o introduced initialization file pSurfInitFile for free surface (cg2d_x)
   in new routine ini_psurf()

checkpoint26
 o moved some #ifdef in optional routines to encompass everything
   except the argument declarations. This was using up some memory.
 o fixed macros like _ADT to work with both versions of Linux cpp
 o cleaned up some unused and uninitialized variables
   (helps when debugging with strict compile options)
 o split up CPP_EEOPTIONS.h into options and macros
   (macros are now in eesupp/inc/CPP_EEMACROS.h)
 o patch for 2 processor JAM mode

checkpoint25
 o updates for OBCs and NH
 o dramatically reduced memory usage
 o added "JAM" routines for use on Artic network
 o parameterization of convection by implicit vertical diffusion
 o added a diagnostic of convective index
 o moved call to calc_divg_hat() from dynamics() to solve_for_pressure()
   (this is was partly for OBCs and NH but also in anticipation of
    an explicit free-surface option)
 o initial state input files for U and V

checkpoint24
 o Removed some spurious "REAL"s
 o Updated KPP to latest version from JPL
 o Added a COS(latitude) in horizontal viscosity

checkpoint23
 o Added del^4 diffusion for salt and temperature
 o Multiple minor fixes (implicit none's, arguments to global_sum, etc.)

checkpoint22
 o Made many small changes: implicit none, format(i5), etc...
 o Introduced KPP mixing scheme (compiles and runs but *not* tested)

checkpoint21
 o Introduced new I/O package that supports direct-access records (mdsio.F)
 o Split-up mid-level I/O routines
 o Updated input data for experiments 0,1,2,4 and 5
 o Finally removed the genmake.* scripts (everyone seems happy with genmake)

checkpoint20
 o Tidied up open-boundaries some more
 o Added non-hydrostatic code
 o Fixed some input data
 o Modified MPI start-up to work in "coupled" context.

checkpoint19
 o Tidied up directory structure for verification experiments.
 o Added new code for open boundaries.
 o Corrected advective terms near boundaries.
 o Added CPP flag for "old UV" geometry and corrected spherical geometry.
 o Implemented free-slip/no-slip BCs and del^4 dissipation.
 o Split default parameters out of ini_parms.F into set_defaults.F.

checkpoint18
 o Further changes for optional code generation with 
   CPP - ugh!

checkpoint17
 o Beginning to incorporating modularity
   for supporting atmos. and ocean configs.
 o Small changes for TAMC complinace
 o New ultra simple test case. Barotropic box
   configuration "exp0".

checkpoint16
 o Minor changes to exchange routines to support 
   accumulation in reverse mode. Adjoint of an
   assignment is an addition.
 o Changes to support compilation by TAMC (LR(1) 
   syntax) and by g77 under Linux ( 72 character
   limit ).

checkpoint15
 Rewrote exchange routines to allow
 o General tile <-> tile connectivity.
 o TAMC reverse mode flag ( is this really needed? )
 o Variable width overlap and exchange region widths.
 o Hooks for sharing data via DMA, Arctic, Memory Channel, 
   shmput/shmget, VIA, SYSV shmem and every other cool 
   communication method.

checkpoint14
 Consistent isomorphism chages made. These allow dynamical core
 to support both pressure and meters as a vertical coordinate.

checkpoint13
 Release which corrects global_max problem and a couple
 of KGM time-averaging diagnostic errors. Also contains
 a double-gyre experiment setup as well as the baseline
 4 degree global template. The double gyre template is
 organised to allow it to be applied automatically to
 the baseline configuration.

branch-point-rdot
 A few tidy-ups have been made bt the real point of this
 check-point (excuse the pun) is to allow a branch to be
 made for the purposes of adding the rDot alterations.
 I don't want to commit the rDot to the main-trunk until
 we've actually tested it...

checkpoint12
 Tidy up and added generic genmake script (formerly
 configure script). 
 Released to testers.

checkpoint11
 Re-arranged initialise() and introduced ini_vertical_grid()
 and ini_masks_etc().

checkpoint10
 Introduced the configure script.
 Separated out the diags package.
 Added template for writing time-averages of tile/intermediate quantities.
 Updated SIZE.h in exp2 and made the data big-endian.

 General tidy-up.
 SST.bin SSS.bin added to verification/exp2

 Works at 4x4 and 2.8125x2.8125 global

checkpoint7-4degree-ref

 global modeling and general modeling - process studies, regional
 model etc..

release1_p8
o verification/natl_box:
  updating new external_fields_load routine
o New package: pkg/seaice
  Sea ice model by D. Menemenlis (JPL) and Jinlun Zhang (Seattle).
  The sea-ice code is based on Hibler (1979-1980).
  Two sea-ice dynamic solvers, ADI and LSR, are included.
  In addition to computing prognostic sea-ice variables and diagnosing 
  the forcing/external data fields that drive the ocean model, 
  SEAICE_MODEL also sets theta to the freezing point under sea-ice.
  The implied surface heat flux is then stored in variable 
  surfaceTendencyTice, which is needed by KPP package (kpp_calc.F and 
  kpp_transport_t.F) to diagnose surface buoyancy fluxes and for the 
  non-local transport term.  Because this call precedes model 
  thermodynamics, temperature under sea-ice may not be "exactly" at 
  the freezing point by the time theta is dumped or time-averaged.
  N.B.: fairly large differences in accuracy occur across
        different platforms/compilers; comparison between
        g77 (Linux) and F77 (SGI Origin 2000/MIPSpro) 
        generated output gives:
   T           S           U           V

release1_p7
o GAD: 
  - generated new common blocks to account for call of

                    bi,bj loop
  mdsio_writelocal - same as mdsio_writetile except works for local
                     arrays

  Controlled by diagFreq. Defaults to zero (ie. no dumps)
  Example given at end of mom_vecinv.F that dumps some local arrays.

  control flux-form versus vector invariant code.
  Switch is runtime flag vectorInvariantMomentum (defaults to false)
  or genmake -DISABLE ...
o TAMC-related update to cope with mom_fluxform.F/mom_vecinc.F
  (additional storing is now needed for case vecinv;
  currently nothing implemented to switch this storing off

checkpoint40pre7
o bug fix in dynamics.F
  calc_viscosity called before k=1,Nr loop.
o added some #ifdef's ALLOW_PASSIVE_TRACER
o cleaned initialisations in ctrl_map_ini

checkpoint40pre5
o proper initialization of Adams-Bashforth time stepping
  + uses forward step for very first step of model (iter=0)
o re-generated *all* output since almost all output is modified by this
  change (sorry but we've been putting this one off for about 2 years)
  + natl_box, aim.5l_Equatorial_Channel and aim.5l_zon-ave were
    *not* regenerated since they are already out of date and I don't
    want to create the impression that they are suddenly working.
o removed KAP stuff for DEC's
o modified/added many .cvsignore files in */code and */input
o added new expt "solid-body.cs-32x32x1"
  + this uses an alternative form of ini_curvilinear_grid.F which
    is not necessarily any better than the current one...

checkpoint40pre4

   cal: calendar
   exf: external forcing
   ecco: essential routines to control use of cal, exf
         (NB: this is not the full ECCO environment)
 o disabled some packages by default in genmake

checkpoint38
 o see notes_c37_adj.txt
 o corrected wrong layer index in external_forcing_t
 o replaced the_main_loop/forward_step by the_main_loop
 o removed forceoutput from write_state
   (replaced criteria for initial/final state)
 o added runtime flag for pre-C35 pickups: usePickupBeforeC35

checkpoint37
 o mdsio.F routine split and packaged in pkg/mdsio
   (mdsio.F and mdsio_gl.F still exist in eesupp/src but are not
    used unless genmake -disable=mdsio)
 o allow a more precise surface-geopotential gradient for the atmosphere
   taking into account the change in space of Alpha (=1/rho) at the surface.
 o variable "etaN" (replace cg2d_x) is the surface R-anomaly [r unit]
   (ocean: sea surface height [m] / atmos: surface pressure anomaly [Pa])
 o Change units: Phi_Hydrostatic (=phiHyd), Phi_Surface(=cg2d_x) and
   Phi_NonHydrostatic (=cg3d_x), all have now the dimension of a potential
   [m2/s2] (pressure/rhoConst in the ocean ; Geo-Potential in the atmosphere).
 o Time-Average diagnostics defined as a pseudo package "timeave".
 o pickup files : old pickup (before c35) did not work with new code (c35
   and after) unless activating 2 commented lines in initialise-varia.
 o Non-Hydrostatic pickup file Pb fixed.
 o bug with Rigid-lid version (since c35) fixed.  

checkpoint36

 o Added mdsio_gl.F for ECCO purposes.

checkpoint33
 o Fixed bug in lower BC in impldiff.F
 o Fixed confusion about units of forcing arrays in FFIELDS.h
   namely Fu,Fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR:
   - Removed verification/natl_box/code/external_fields_scale.F
     (did not differ from that in model/src)
   - Changed units of fu,fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR back to proper units
     (see FFIELDS.h for description)
   - Scale fu,fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR when used in external_forcing_surf.F,
     kpp_calc.F and kpp_transport_t.F
   - Removed model/src/external_fields_scale.F and calls to it
   - verification/natl_box uses flux data with "atmospheric" sign so
     a special version of external_fields_load.F is used to
     change the data as it's read in. This way, the arrays
     have the right units and signs at all times tha a user could
     possibly use them.
 o Corrected genmake to delete a temporary file during configuration

checkpoint32
 o Scaling of forcing fields moved from external_forcing.F to
   external_fields_scale.F, called directly after loading fields.

   -> new routines packages_...F
   -> changes in initialise_fixed.F, initialise_varia.F
   -> enables initialisation interface for ECCO package
 o Rescaling of external forcing fields immediately after read
   (removed from external_forcing.F) 
   -> new: surface_fields_scale.F
   -> affects ini_foorcing.F, external_fields_load.F
 o Computation of surface tendencies before tendency updates.
   -> new: external_forcing_surf.F
 o Change of variable names useGMRedi, useKPP, useECCO
 o Further changes in dynamics.F, impldiff.F for TAMC

 o routines calc_common_factors, calc_gs, calc_gt, calc_phi_hyd, find_rho:
   included some initialisations required for TAMC.
 o routine calc_isoslopes: modified sqrt computation to make it 
   differentiable for zero argument.
 o routines dynamics, impldiff:
   included store directives and tape key computations required for TAMC.
 o ALL TAMC related changes are between ifdef ALLOW_AUTODIFF_TAMC

checkpoint27
 o fixed calc_isoslopes() to so that cancellation of terms in tensor
   formulation works properly with variable resolution.
 o restructured the calling tree between the_model_main() and dynamics()
 o split initialise() into initialise_fixed() and initialise_varia()
 o introduced initialization file pSurfInitFile for free surface (cg2d_x)
   in new routine ini_psurf()

checkpoint26
 o moved some #ifdef in optional routines to encompass everything
   except the argument declarations. This was using up some memory.
 o fixed macros like _ADT to work with both versions of Linux cpp
 o cleaned up some unused and uninitialized variables
   (helps when debugging with strict compile options)
 o split up CPP_EEOPTIONS.h into options and macros
   (macros are now in eesupp/inc/CPP_EEMACROS.h)
 o patch for 2 processor JAM mode

checkpoint25
 o updates for OBCs and NH
 o dramatically reduced memory usage
 o added "JAM" routines for use on Artic network
 o parameterization of convection by implicit vertical diffusion

 to support both pressure and meters as a vertical coordinate.

checkpoint13
 Release which corrects global_max problem and a couple
 of KGM time-averaging diagnostic errors. Also contains
 a double-gyre experiment setup as well as the baseline
 4 degree global template. The double gyre template is
 organised to allow it to be applied automatically to
 the baseline configuration.

branch-point-rdot
 A few tidy-ups have been made bt the real point of this
 check-point (excuse the pun) is to allow a branch to be
 made for the purposes of adding the rDot alterations.
 I don't want to commit the rDot to the main-trunk until
 we've actually tested it...

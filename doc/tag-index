    Notes on tags used in MITgcmUV
    ==============================

o argument futureIter of S/R obcs_calc missing in exp4 & internal_wave /code
o solve_for_pressure : set cg2d_x to zero where OBCS are applied

checkpoint44h_post = checkpoint45
o Fix to restore differentiability:
  place at which packages_init_variables is called in
  initialise_varia is crucial for reverse control flow.
o modifications in GMRedi to enable stable adjoint
  (corresponding modif's in thermodynamics, dynamics)
o added missing hook for sponge layer code in external_forcing
o modified test cost functions
o storing in gad_advection (plus removal of write(0,*)!
o missing headers TR1.h added in convective_adjustment routines
o errorMessageUnit set non-equal zero in eeboot
  (conflict on some platforms, e.g. IBM SP3)
o modified carbon verif.

checkpoint44h_pre
o vertical grid option: allow to put the Interface at the middle between
  2 cell-centers ; replace delZ in pkg/kpp by drF.
o GM Advective form: Tracers are advected using the residual transport (=
  Euler+GM-bolus); set param GM_AdvSeparate=T to return to previous form.

checkpoint44g_post
o fix surface correction term in multiDimAdvection (affects plume_on_slope 
  results) ; ifdef missing in thermodynamics.F

checkpoint44f_pre,checkpoint44f_post
o added PTRACERS package
  This allows an arbitrary number of passive tracers to be integrated
  forward simultaneously with the dynamicaly model.
  + Implemented so far:
    - basic forward algorithm (time-stepping, advection, diffusion, convection)
    - I/O and checkpointing
    - GM/Redi  *but*  using the GM/Redi coefficient of Salt
  + Not implemented so far:
    - KPP
    - OBCS
  + No specific example supplied (yet) but global_ocean.90x40x15 has the
    necessary data.ptracer file. Simply use -enable=ptracers and uncomment
    line in data.pkg.
  + This package is disabled by default since it increases storage.


o testscript: added -cleanup option
o Shap_filt: a) new shap_filt S/R to use no-slip BC with S2 filter
             b) enable to filter 2D fields.

checkpoint44e_pre,post
o re-wrote convective adjustment to use pre-calculated weights
  Affects: model/src/convective_adjustment.F, convective_adjustment_ini.F
  Adds:    model/src/convective_weights.F, convectively_mixtracer.F
  Original calls to convect() still in place.

chkpt44d_pre,post
o added missing EXCLUDE_MONITOR flags
o changed "e" to "_d" in gmredi_slope_limit, gmredi_slope_psi
  (incompatible typ in MIN/MAX expressions caused problems
  on IBM SP3)
o in genmake added variable MAKEDEPEND
  plus resetting for case SunOS
o added timer_stats.c routine for IBM SP3
o removed variables in dynamics
!!! I forgot to create tag chkpt44d_pre !!!
!!! But chkpt44d_pre = chkpt44c_post    !!!

o real fresh water flux implemented with non-linear free-surface.

chkpt44c_pre,post
o few fix (mask in shap_s2, EmPmR in external_field_load, 
  USE_NATURAL_BCS in solve_for_P); 
o add arguments myIter & myTime to S/R obcs_calc & solve_for_P

checkpoint44b_pre/_post
o merge of relevant stuff from the ecco-branch:
  - genmake: removed $S64 overwrite for case SunOS
  - pkg/exf: update and corrections for field swapping and obcs
  - pkg/ecco: parameter lists for the_model_main, the_main_loop
              harmonized between ECCO and MITgcm
  - pkg/autodiff: added flow directives for obcs, mdsio_gl_slice
                  updated checkpointing_lev... lists for obcs
  - model/src: minor changes in forward_step, plot_field
               added directive for divided adjoint in the_main_loop
  - pkg/mdsio: added mdsio_gl_slice

o check parameters & config (chkpt44a_pre,post)

  (mainly thermodynamics.F)
o New store directives for multi-dim. advection schemes
  * new CPP flag ALLOW_MULTI_DIM_ADVECTION
  * new common block and key passkey
  (mainly gad_advection.F)

  for the case ALLOW_KPP
o Cleaned argument list for timestep_tracer.F

checkpoint41
o re-formatted/added comments in prologues of key subroutines

checkpoint40
o moved calc_gs, calc_gt and calc_tr1 back to model/src
o added FLT (floats) package from Arne along with demo. experiment
o re-arranged Adams-Bashforth scheme for tracers to allow easier
  implementation of forward-in-time forcing terms

checkpoint40pre8
o new package rw/
  Added method for dumping intermediate local arrays:
  mdsio_writetile - same as mdsio_writefield except works from inside
                    bi,bj loop
  mdsio_writelocal - same as mdsio_writetile except works for local
                     arrays
  write_local_r? - higher-level wrapper for mdsio_writelocal
  Controlled by diagFreq. Defaults to zero (ie. no dumps)
  Example given at end of mom_vecinv.F that dumps some local arrays.
o replaced calc_mom_rhs.F by mom_fluxform.F/mom_vecinc.F to
  control flux-form versus vector invariant code.
  Switch is runtime flag vectorInvariantMomentum (defaults to false)
  or genmake -DISABLE ...
o TAMC-related update to cope with mom_fluxform.F/mom_vecinc.F
  (additional storing is now needed for case vecinv;
  currently nothing implemented to switch this storing off
  in case fluxform is used since no CPP flag available).

checkpoint40pre7
o bug fix in dynamics.F
  calc_viscosity called before k=1,Nr loop.
o added some #ifdef's ALLOW_PASSIVE_TRACER
o cleaned initialisations in ctrl_map_ini
  related to TAF

checkpoint40pre6

o corresponding split of calc_diffusivity into
  calc_diffusivity, calc_viscosity
  (kpp_calc_diff, kpp_calc_visc).
o Added diffkr, kapgm to control variables
o bug fix in gmredi_slope_limit for ldd97

checkpoint40pre5
o proper initialization of Adams-Bashforth time stepping
  + uses forward step for very first step of model (iter=0)
o re-generated *all* output since almost all output is modified by this
  change (sorry but we've been putting this one off for about 2 years)
  + natl_box, aim.5l_Equatorial_Channel and aim.5l_zon-ave were
    *not* regenerated since they are already out of date and I don't
    want to create the impression that they are suddenly working.
o removed KAP stuff for DEC's
o modified/added many .cvsignore files in */code and */input
o added new expt "solid-body.cs-32x32x1"
  + this uses an alternative form of ini_curvilinear_grid.F which
    is not necessarily any better than the current one...

checkpoint40pre4
o added re-initialisations of utrans,vtrans,rtrans in
  calc_common_factors which are crucial for TAF.

   in addummy_in_stepping
 o Updated verification/vero/ (bug fixes in code/, correct pickups in input/)
 o Enabled "sliced" (xz-,yz-) exchanges, needed for obcs.
 o Included following packages:
   cal: calendar
   exf: external forcing
   ecco: essential routines to control use of cal, exf
         (NB: this is not the full ECCO environment)
 o disabled some packages by default in genmake

checkpoint38
 o see notes_c37_adj.txt
 o corrected wrong layer index in external_forcing_t
 o replaced the_main_loop/forward_step by the_main_loop
 o removed forceoutput from write_state
   (replaced criteria for initial/final state)
 o added runtime flag for pre-C35 pickups: usePickupBeforeC35

checkpoint37
 o mdsio.F routine split and packaged in pkg/mdsio
   (mdsio.F and mdsio_gl.F still exist in eesupp/src but are not
    used unless genmake -disable=mdsio)
 o allow a more precise surface-geopotential gradient for the atmosphere
   taking into account the change in space of Alpha (=1/rho) at the surface.
 o variable "etaN" (replace cg2d_x) is the surface R-anomaly [r unit]
   (ocean: sea surface height [m] / atmos: surface pressure anomaly [Pa])
 o Change units: Phi_Hydrostatic (=phiHyd), Phi_Surface(=cg2d_x) and
   Phi_NonHydrostatic (=cg3d_x), all have now the dimension of a potential
   [m2/s2] (pressure/rhoConst in the ocean ; Geo-Potential in the atmosphere).
 o Time-Average diagnostics defined as a pseudo package "timeave".
 o pickup files : old pickup (before c35) did not work with new code (c35
   and after) unless activating 2 commented lines in initialise-varia.
 o Non-Hydrostatic pickup file Pb fixed.
 o bug with Rigid-lid version (since c35) fixed.  

checkpoint36
 o implement Crank-Nickelson barotropic time-stepping
 o recover Time-Average diagnostics
 o fix Pb in checkpoint (PR#19) 
 o AIM become a standard package ; clean unused CPP_kees

checkpoint35
 o subtantial rewrite of dynamics.f
 o allows staggered time-stepping
 o packaged obcs, aim (Atmospheric Physics), zonal_filt, shap_filt
 o added bottom drag (linear + quadratic)

checkpoint34
 o Modified exchange routines for correct reverse simulation.
 o Added verification output to comply with bug fix in impldiff.F
   as of c33 (exp2, natl_box).
 o Corrected store directives in dynamics.F
 o Corrected array boundaries in impldiff.F
 o Corrected array dimensions in gmredi.
   Added temporary scalars to avoid storage by TAMC (gmredi, kpp).
 o Added routine GLOBAL_SUM_INT to global_sum.F
 o Added mdsio_gl.F for ECCO purposes.

checkpoint33
 o Fixed bug in lower BC in impldiff.F
 o Fixed confusion about units of forcing arrays in FFIELDS.h
   namely Fu,Fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR:
   - Removed verification/natl_box/code/external_fields_scale.F
     (did not differ from that in model/src)
   - Changed units of fu,fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR back to proper units
     (see FFIELDS.h for description)
   - Scale fu,fv,Qnet,Qsw,EmPmR when used in external_forcing_surf.F,
     kpp_calc.F and kpp_transport_t.F
   - Removed model/src/external_fields_scale.F and calls to it
   - verification/natl_box uses flux data with "atmospheric" sign so
     a special version of external_fields_load.F is used to
     change the data as it's read in. This way, the arrays
     have the right units and signs at all times tha a user could
     possibly use them.
 o Corrected genmake to delete a temporary file during configuration

checkpoint32
 o Scaling of forcing fields moved from external_forcing.F to
   external_fields_scale.F, called directly after loading fields.
 o Surface relaxation terms added to surface tendency fields in
   extra subroutine.

   fields.
 o Changes in GMRedi to comply with packaging structure.
 o Modifications and bug fixes in KPP package.
 o Verification experiment for KPP added (verification/nat_box/)

checkpoint31

   -> new routines packages_...F
   -> changes in initialise_fixed.F, initialise_varia.F
   -> enables initialisation interface for ECCO package
 o Rescaling of external forcing fields immediately after read
   (removed from external_forcing.F) 
   -> new: surface_fields_scale.F
   -> affects ini_foorcing.F, external_fields_load.F
 o Computation of surface tendencies before tendency updates.
   -> new: external_forcing_surf.F
 o Change of variable names useGMRedi, useKPP, useECCO
 o Further changes in dynamics.F, impldiff.F for TAMC
 o Tested for experiments 0, 2, 4.
   - not yet tested for GMRedi.
   - not yet tested for KPP.

 o routines calc_common_factors, calc_gs, calc_gt, calc_phi_hyd, find_rho:
   included some initialisations required for TAMC.
 o routine calc_isoslopes: modified sqrt computation to make it 
   differentiable for zero argument.
 o routines dynamics, impldiff:
   included store directives and tape key computations required for TAMC.
 o ALL TAMC related changes are between ifdef ALLOW_AUTODIFF_TAMC

checkpoint27
 o fixed calc_isoslopes() to so that cancellation of terms in tensor
   formulation works properly with variable resolution.
 o restructured the calling tree between the_model_main() and dynamics()
 o split initialise() into initialise_fixed() and initialise_varia()
 o introduced initialization file pSurfInitFile for free surface (cg2d_x)
   in new routine ini_psurf()

checkpoint26
 o moved some #ifdef in optional routines to encompass everything
   except the argument declarations. This was using up some memory.
 o fixed macros like _ADT to work with both versions of Linux cpp
 o cleaned up some unused and uninitialized variables
   (helps when debugging with strict compile options)
 o split up CPP_EEOPTIONS.h into options and macros
   (macros are now in eesupp/inc/CPP_EEMACROS.h)
 o patch for 2 processor JAM mode

checkpoint25
 o updates for OBCs and NH
 o dramatically reduced memory usage
 o added "JAM" routines for use on Artic network
 o parameterization of convection by implicit vertical diffusion
 o added a diagnostic of convective index
 o moved call to calc_divg_hat() from dynamics() to solve_for_pressure()

checkpoint21
 o Introduced new I/O package that supports direct-access records (mdsio.F)
 o Split-up mid-level I/O routines
 o Updated input data for experiments 0,1,2,4 and 5
 o Finally removed the genmake.* scripts (everyone seems happy with genmake)

checkpoint20

 o Added CPP flag for "old UV" geometry and corrected spherical geometry.
 o Implemented free-slip/no-slip BCs and del^4 dissipation.
 o Split default parameters out of ini_parms.F into set_defaults.F.

checkpoint18
 o Further changes for optional code generation with 
   CPP - ugh!

checkpoint17

   for supporting atmos. and ocean configs.
 o Small changes for TAMC complinace
 o New ultra simple test case. Barotropic box
   configuration "exp0".

checkpoint16

   accumulation in reverse mode. Adjoint of an
   assignment is an addition.

   syntax) and by g77 under Linux ( 72 character
   limit ).

checkpoint15
 Rewrote exchange routines to allow
 o General tile <-> tile connectivity.
 o TAMC reverse mode flag ( is this really needed? )

 o Hooks for sharing data via DMA, Arctic, Memory Channel, 
   shmput/shmget, VIA, SYSV shmem and every other cool 
   communication method.

checkpoint14
 Consistent isomorphism chages made. These allow dynamical core
 to support both pressure and meters as a vertical coordinate.

checkpoint13
 Release which corrects global_max problem and a couple
 of KGM time-averaging diagnostic errors. Also contains
 a double-gyre experiment setup as well as the baseline
 4 degree global template. The double gyre template is
 organised to allow it to be applied automatically to
 the baseline configuration.

branch-point-rdot
 A few tidy-ups have been made bt the real point of this
 check-point (excuse the pun) is to allow a branch to be
 made for the purposes of adding the rDot alterations.
 I don't want to commit the rDot to the main-trunk until
 we've actually tested it...

checkpoint12
 Tidy up and added generic genmake script (formerly
 configure script). 
 Released to testers.

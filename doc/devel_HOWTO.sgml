      <title>Prerequisites</title> <para>To develop for MITgcm project
      you will need a UNIX or UNIX-like set of build tools including
      the following:</para>
      <blockquote>
	<simplelist type="inline">
	  <member>CVS client</member>
	  <member>make or (preferably) GNU make</member>

      </blockquote>
      <para>Essentially all of the work described here has been tested
      on recent versions of Red Hat Linux (eg. 7.3 through 9).  Except
      where noted, all shell commands will be provided using bash
      syntax.

      <para>Unlike many open source projects, the MITgcm CVS tree does
      not follow a simple "src", "docs", "share", and "test" directory
      layout.  Instead, there are multiple higher-level directories
      that each, to some extent, depend upon the presence of the
      others.  The tree currently resembles:</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Branches</title>

      <para>As shown in the online <ulink
      url="http://dev.mitgcm.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/MITgcm/doc/tag-index?graph=1.174">ViewCVS-generated
      tree</ulink>, the MITgcm codebase is split into to two branches
      or "lines" under which development proceeds.  These two lines
      are referred to as the "MAIN" and "ecco" versions of the code.
      While not identical, the bulk of the MAIN and ecco lines are
      composed of files from the same codebase.
      </para>

      <para>Periodically, a "Release" branch is formed from the "MAIN"
      development branch.  This is done in order to create a
      relatively stable reference point for both users and developers.
      The intent is that once a relese branch has been created, only
      bug-fixes will be added to it.  Meanwhile, development (which
      might "break" or otherwise render invalid the documentation,
      tutorials, and/or examples contained within a release branch) is
      allowed to continue along the MAIN and ecco lines.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Tagging</title>

      <para>The intent of tagging is to create "known-good"
      checkpoints that developers can use as references.
      Traditionally, MITgcm tagging has maintained the following
      conventions:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Developer checks out code into a local CVS-managed
	  directory, makes various changes/additions, tests these
	  edits, and eventually reaches a point where (s)he is
	  satisfied that the changes form a new "useful" point in the
	  evolution of the code.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The developer then runs the <ulink
          url="http://dev.mitgcm.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/MITgcm/verification/testscript">testscript</ulink>
          shell script to see if any problems are introduced.  While
          not intended to be exhaustive, the test cases within the
          verification directory do provide some indication whether
          gross errors have been introduced.
          </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Having satisfied him- or herself that the changes are
	  ready to be committed to the CVS repository, the developer
	  then:</para>
	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>adds a "checkpointXY_pre" comment (where X is a
	      checkpoint number and Y is a letter) to the <ulink
	      url="http://dev.mitgcm.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/MITgcm/doc/tag-index">tag-index</ulink>
	      file and checks it into the CVS repository</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>submits the set of changes to the CVS repository
	      and adds comments to <filename>tag-index</filename>
	      describing what the changes are along with a matching
	      "checkpointXY_post" entry</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>The result of this tagging procedure is a sequence of
      development checkpoints with comments which resembles:</para>

<programlisting>
checkpoint50e_post
o make KPP work with PTRACERS
 - fix gad_calc_rhs to call new routine kpp_transport_ptr, which is
   nearly a copy of kpp_transport_s
 - there is no analogue to SurfaceTendencyS, so I have to use 
   gPtr(of the surface layer) instead
o add a new platform SunFire+mpi (SunFire 15000) to genmake
checkpoint50e_pre

checkpoint50d_post
o change kpp output from multiple-record state files to single-record state 
  files analogous to write_state.F
o reduce the output frequency of cg3d-related stuff to the monitor frequency, 
  analogous to the cg2d-related output. 
o fix small problem with in ptracers_write_checkpoint.F: len(suff)=512, 
  so that writing to internal file fn (with length 512) fails.
checkpoint50d_pre
</programlisting>

      <para>This information can be used to refer to various stages of
      the code development.  For example, bugs can be traced to
      individual sets of CVS checkins based upon their first
      appearance when comparing the results from different
      checkpoints.</para>

  <sect1 id="documentation">
    <title>Editing the Documentation</title>

    <sect2 id="documentation_getting">
      <title>Getting the Docs and Code</title>

      <para>The first step towards editing the documentation is to
      checkout a copy of code, docs, and build scripts from the CVS
      server using:</para>

<screen>
$ export CVS_RSH=ssh
$ export CVSROOT=':ext:auden.lcs.mit.edu:/u/u3/gcmpack'
$ mkdir scratch
$ cvs co MITgcm manual mitgcm.org
</screen>

      <para>These commands extract the necessary information from the
      CVS server and create a temporary (called
      <filename>scratch</filename>) directory for the storage of the
      HTML and other files that will be created.  Please note that you
      must either create <filename>scratch</filename> as shown or edit
      the various <filename>Makefile</filename>s and scripts used to
      create the documentation.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Editing</title>

      <para>The documentation is contained in the
      <filename>manual</filename> directory in a raw LaTeX format.
      The main document is <filename>manual.tex</filename> and it uses
      <command>\input{}</command>s to include the chapters and
      subsections.</para>

      <para>Since the same LaTeX source is used to produce PostScript,
      PDF, and HTML output, care should be taken to follow certain
      conventions.  Two of the most important are the usage of the
      <command>\filelink{}{}</command> and
      <command>\varlink{}{}</command> commands.  Both of these
      commands have been defined to simplify the connection between
      the automatically generated ("code browser") HTML and the HTML
      version of the manual produced by LaTeX2HTML.  They each take
      two arguments (corresponding to the contents of the two sets of
      curly braces) which are the text that the author wishes to be
      "wrapped" within the link, and a specially formatted link thats
      relative to the <filename>MITgcm</filename> directory within the
      CVS tree.</para>

      <para>The result is a command that resembles either</para>
      
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>a reference to a variable or subroutine name such as
	  <command>\varlink{tRef}{tRef}</command>, or </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>a reference to a file such as
	      <command>\varlink{tRef}{path-to-the-file_name.F}</command>
	      where the absolute path to the file is of the form
	      <filename>/foo/MITgcm/path/to/the/file_name.F</filename></para>
	      <para>(please note how the leading "/foo/MITgcm"
	      component of the path is dropped leaving the path
	      <emphasis>relative</emphasis> to the head of the code
	      directory and each directory separator "/" is turned
	      into a "-")</para>

           MITgcmUV Packages
           =================

  Optional parts of code are separated from
the MITgcmUV core driver code and organised into
packages. The packaging structure provides a mechanism for
maintaining suites of code, specific to particular
classes of problem, in a way that is cleanly
separated from the generic fluid dynamical engine.

 The MITgcmUV packaging structure is describe
below using generic package names ${pkg}.
A concrete examples of a package is the code
for implementing GM/Redi mixing. This code uses
the package name 
*   ${PKG} = GMREDI
*   ${pkg} = gmredi
*   ${Pkg} = gmRedi

Package states
==============

 Packages can be any one of four states, included,
 excluded, enabled, disabled as follows:

 included(excluded) compile time state which
                    includes(excludes) package
                    code and routine calls from
                    compilation/linking etc...

 enabled(disabled)  run-time state which
                    enables(disables) package code
                    execution.

 Every call to a ${pkg}_... routine from outside the package
 should be placed within both a
 #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG} ... block and a
 if ( use${Pkg} ) ... then block.
 Package states are generally not expected to change during
 a model run.

Package structure
=================

o  Each package gets its runtime configuration
   parameters from a file named "data.${pkg}"
   Package runtime config. options are imported
   into a common block held in a header file
   called "${PKG}.h".

o  The core driver part of the model can check
   for runtime enabling or disabling of individual packages
   through logical flags use${Pkg}.
   The information is loaded from a
   global package setup file called "data.pkg".
   The use${Pkg} flags are not used within
   individual packages.

o  Included in "${PKG}.h" is a logical flag
   called ${Pkg}IsOn. The "${PKG}.h" header file can be imported
   by other packages to check dependencies and requirements
   from other packages ( see "Package Boot Sequence" section).
   NOTE: This procedure is not presently implemented,
   ----- neither for kpp nor for gmRedi.

CPP Flags
=========

    1. Within the core driver code flags of the form
       ALLOW_${PKG} are used to include or exclude
       whole packages. The ALLOW_${PKG} flags are included
       from a PKG_CPP_OPTIONS block which is currently
       held in-line in the CPP_OPTIONS.h header file.
       e.g.

       Core model code .....

       #include "CPP_OPTIONS.h"
         :
         :
         :

       #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG}
         if ( use${Pkg} ) CALL ${PKG}_DO_SOMETHING(...)
       #endif

    2. Within an individual package a header file,
       "${PKG}_OPTIONS.h", is used to set CPP flags
       specific to that package. It is not recommended
       to include this file in "CPP_OPTIONS.h".


Package Boot Sequence
=====================

    Calls to package routines within the core code timestepping
    loop can vary. However, all packages follow a required
    "boot" sequence outlined here:

    1. S/R PACKAGES_BOOT()
            :
        CALL OPEN_COPY_DATA_FILE( 'data.pkg', 'PACKAGES_BOOT', ... )
 

    2. S/R PACKAGES_READPARMS()
            :
        #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG}
          if ( use${Pkg} )
     &       CALL ${PKG}_READPARMS( retCode )
        #endif

    2. S/R PACKAGES_CHECK()
            :
        #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG}
          if ( use${Pkg} )
     &       CALL ${PKG}_CHECK( retCode )
        #else
          if ( use${Pkg} )
     &       CALL PACKAGES_CHECK_ERROR('${PKG}')
        #endif

    3. S/R PACKAGES_INIT()
            :
        #ifdef ALLOW_${PKG}
          if ( use${Pkg} )
     &       CALL ${PKG}_INIT( retCode )
        #endif


Description
===========

      - ${PKG}_READPARMS() 
    is responsible for reading
    in the package parameters file data.${pkg}, and storing
    the package parameters in "${PKG}.h".
    -> called in INITIALISE_FIXED

     - ${PKG}_CHECK() 
    is responsible for validating
    basic package setup and inter-package dependencies.
    ${PKG}_CHECK can import other package parameters it may
    need to check. This is done through header files "${PKG}.h".
    It is assumed that parameters owned by other packages
    will not be reset during ${PKG}_CHECK().
    -> called in INITIALISE_FIXED

     - ${PKG}_INIT() 
    is responsible for completing the
    internal setup of a package. This routine is called after
    the core model state has been completely initialised
    but before the core model timestepping starts.
    -> called in INITIALISE_VARIA

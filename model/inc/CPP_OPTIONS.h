  These lines are here to deliberately cause a compile-time error.
  If you see these lines in your .F files or the compiler shows them
  as an error then it means you have not placed your configuration
  files in the appropriate place.
  You need to place you own copy of CPP_OPTIONS.h in the include
  path for the model.

C     | The common blocks set up here are used in the elliptic   |
C     | equation inversion. They are also used as the interface  |
C     | to the rest of the model. To set the source term for the |
C     | solver set the appropriate array below. To read the      |
C     | solution read from the appropriate array below.          |

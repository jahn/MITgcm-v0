The experiments:

exp0 - single layer, double gyre (barotropic with free-surface).
exp1 - 4 layer, double gyre.
exp2 - 4x4 degree global simulation with steady climatological forcing.
exp3 - atmospheric configuration ? (but empty)
exp4 - flow over a Gaussian bump in open-water or channel with open
       boundaries.
exp5 - inhomogenously forced convection in a doubly periodic box.
front_relax   - relaxation of a thermal front (test for GM scheme). 2D (Y-Z).
internal_wave - internal wave forced by open boundary conditions.
natl_box      - eastern subtropical North Atlantic with KPP; 1 month integration
hs94.1x64x5   - Zonal averaged atmosphere using Held and Suarez '94 forcing.
hs94.128x64x5   - 3-D atmosphere Dynamics using Held and Suarez '94 forcing.
aim.5l_zon-ave  - Intermediate Atmospheric physics, 5 layers Molteni Physics 
		package. Global Zonal Mean configuration, 1x64x5 resolution.

And also (but not completely  tested) :
aim.5l_Equatorial_Channel

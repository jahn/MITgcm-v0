Example: "4 Layer Double Gyre with Pressure Loading"
====================================================

To apply the changes to the default configuration of MITgcmUV:
  cp ../verification/inverted_barometer/code/SIZE.h ../model/inc/
  cp ../verification/inverted_barometer/code/CPP_OPTIONS.h ../model/inc/
  cp ../verification/inverted_barometer/code/CPP_EEOPTIONS.h ../eesupp/inc/

Configure and compile the code:
  cd bin
  ../tools/genmake -makefile
  make depend
  make

To run:
  cd ../exe
  cp ../verification/inverted_barometer/input/* .
  dmpirun -np 4 mitgcmuv  ( Digital )

There is comparison output in two directories:
 ../verification/inverted_barometer/results

Comments:
The input data is real*8 and can be generated with the supplied
matlab script gendata.m  to change the input precision to
real*4 change readBinaryPrec=32 in data as well as in gendata.m

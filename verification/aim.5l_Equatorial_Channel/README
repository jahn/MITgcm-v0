Five level intermediate atmospheric physics example.
Experimental configuration is an equatorial channel.
+/- 30 degrees wide with a warm pool SST anomaly extending over 
twenty degrees zonally and +/- 10 degrees meridionally.
==================================================================== 

o To reproduce the run : 

The genmake options are in .genmakerc, so that the simplest form
of genmake can be used :
cd input
../../../tools/genmake
make depend
make

mitgcmuv

--------------------------- 
Notes:
* To produce a short test that is relevant for the Atmosphere physics part,
  a restart file (pickup.0000008640) is included. Otherwise, starting from
  rest requires several days of spin up.
* Need to add a sink of heat or a restoring term near N & S boundaries
  to balance the radiative heating. As it is now, it cannot be integrated
  more than 7 or 8 months.
* many sources in "code" are identical or very similar to the "aim_5l_LatLon"
  test and will became part of the pkg/aim code.

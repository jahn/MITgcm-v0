Example: "4 Layer Double Gyre"
==============================

To apply the changes to the default configuration of MITgcmUV:
  cp ../verification/exp1/code/SIZE.h ../model/inc/
  cp ../verification/exp1/code/CPP_OPTIONS.h ../model/inc/
  cp ../verification/exp1/code/CPP_EEOPTIONS.h ../eesupp/inc/

Configure and compile the code:
  cd bin
  ../tools/genmake -makefile
  make depend
  make

To run:
  cd ../exe
  cp ../verification/exp1/input/* .
  dmpirun -np 4 mitgcmuv  ( Digital )

There is comparison output in two directories:
 ../verification/exp1/results
 ../verification/exp1/results.oldcode

To obtain the "oldcode" numbers make the following changes
to the older code: 
CPP_OPTIONS.h must have
  #define OLD_ADV_BCS
  #define OLD_UV_GEOMETRY
calc_mom_rhs.F must have
  #define NO_LATERAL_SLIP
  #define NO_BOTTOM_SLIP
ini_depths.F must have the "island" removed.

Comments:
The input data is real*8 and can be generated with the supplied
matlab script gendata.m  to change the input precision to
real*4 change readBinaryPrec=32 in data as well as in gendata.m

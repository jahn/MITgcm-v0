Example: "4x4 Global Simulation with Seasonal Forcing"
=======================================

To apply the changes to the default configuration of MITgcmUV:
Configure and compile the code:
  cd verification/global_ocean.90x40x15/input
  ../../../tools/genmake -mods='../code'
  make depend
  make
To run the code:
  ./mitgcmuv

There is comparison output in directory:
 ../verification/global_ocean.90x40x15/results

Comments:
o The input data is real*4.
o The surface fluxes are derived from monthly means of the NCEP climatology;
  - a matlab script is provided that created the surface flux data files from 
    the original NCEP data: ncep2global_ocean.m in the diags_matlab directory,
    needs editing to adjust search paths.
o matlab scripts that make a simple diagnostic (barotropic stream function,
  overturning stream functions, averaged hydrography etc.) is provided in
  diags_matlab:
  - mit_loadglobal is the toplevel script that run all other scripts
  - mit_globalmovie animates theta, salinity, and 3D-velocity field for
    a layer "iz", if "meanfields=0"

Intermediate Atmospheric physics, 5 layers Molteni Physics package.
Global spherical-grid configuration, 128x64x5 resolution.
====================================================================

o To reproduce the run :

The genmake options are in .genmakerc, so that the simplest form
of genmake can be used :
cd input 
../../../tools/genmake
make depend 
make

mitgcmuv

---------------------------
Note: 
This experiment has been run for 1 year on cote (d')azur (Linux 4 cpu)
with compiler pgf77
This set up is very close to the one in 
/development/adcroft/atmos/verification/molteni.128x64x5
with few modifications taken from run on hyades.

An upgrade of this experiment will be done to improve the
quality of the results (e.g., a less diffuse Advection Schemme for Q)

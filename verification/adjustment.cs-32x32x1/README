Simple 1 layer, Barotropic adjustment on the Sphere, using the 
cubed-sphere grid 32x32x32
=================================================================

General Description:
* using the same executable, 2 set-up can be tested, corresponding 
  to input dir. "input" and "input.nlfs".
* Default set-up (input & parameter files in dir "input"):
  Oceanic set-up with flat bottom and a large quasi-rectangular 
  continent is initially at rest. An initial free-surface large-scale 
  anomaly centered at the equator triggers a barotropic adjustment 
  and generates External Inertial-Gravity waves (Poincare waves).
  Use linear Free-Surface and linear dynamics (no momentum advection)
* Additional set-up (input & parameter files in dir "input.nlfs"):
  Atmospheric set-up, without orography, initially at rest. 
  An initial large-scale surface pressure anomaly generated pure
  external gravity waves.
  Use non-linear Free-Surface, linear dynamics (no momentum advection)
  without rotation.

IMPORTANT: For the purpose of testing multiple tiles and "blank-tiles":
* Use multiple tiles (8) per cube-face (tile size: 16x8),
  which results in a total of 48 tiles:
    code/SIZE.h 
    code/W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h : to replace pkg/exch2/W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h
                               ( = 6-tiles default version )
    code/w2_e2setup.F        : to replace pkg/exch2/W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h
  the last 2 files ave been generated with matlab script:
        MITgcm/utils/exch2/matlab-topology-generator/driver.m
* The oceanic-set-up contains 4 empty tiles (tiles: 11,12,13,14)
  associated with the large continent.
  This gives the opportunity to test the "blank-tiles" option of 
  the EXCH2 pkg. An MPI version of this set-up is available to 
  test this "blank-tiles" option:
    code/SIZE.h_mpi          : to replace code/SIZE.h
    code/W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h : to replace pkg/exch2/W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h
    code/w2_e2setup.F_mpi    : to replace code/CPP_EEOPTIONS.h_mpi
      generated with matlab script: 
        MITgcm/utils/exch2/matlab-topology-generator/driver.m
      using the blank-list file: code/blanklist.txt
    code/CPP_EEOPTIONS.h_mpi : to replace eesupp/inc/CPP_EEOPTIONS.h
  However, this particular (MPI) executable cannot be used for the 
  atmospheric set-up (input.nlfs) and, in this case, an error 
  from S/R EXCH2_CHECK_DEPTHS will stop the execution.

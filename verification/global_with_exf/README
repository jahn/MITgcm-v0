This verification experiment is almost identical to the
global_ocean.90x40x15 experiment, except that it uses
the exf (and cal) package instead of the 
external_fields_load routine.
To obtain identical results between the two experiments,
the following 2 modifications are necessary:
1. in external_fields_load.F:
   replace the line
      Imytm=int(myTime*rdt+0.5)
   by
      Imytm=int((myTime+1296000.)*rdt+0.5)
2. in exf_set_climsst.F:
   comment the 'quality' check, i.e. avoid the setting
   to freezing temperature if less than climtempfreeze.

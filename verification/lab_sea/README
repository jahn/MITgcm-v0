Example: Labrador Sea Region with Sea-Ice
=========================================

This example sets up a small (20x16x23) Labrador Sea experiment
coupled to a dynamic thermodynamic sea-ice model.
A brief description of the sea-ice model is in "seaice.ps".

This experiment is a 1-cpu, 10-hour integration used to test
CPP option SEAICE_EXTERNAL_FORCING.  Atmospheric state is read-in
using pkg/exf, rather than pkg/seaice routines.  This experiment
uses pkg/gmredi, pkg/kpp, pkg/seaice, and pkg/exf.

The domain of integration spans 280E to 320E and 46N to 78N.
Horizontal grid spacing is 2 degrees.
The 23 vertical levels and the bathymetry file
  bathyFile      = 'bathy.labsea'
are obtained from the the 2-degree ECCO configuration.

Integration is initialized from annual-mean Levitus climatology
 hydrogThetaFile = 'LevCli_temp.labsea'
 hydrogSaltFile  = 'LevCli_salt.labsea'

Surface salinity relaxation is to the monthly mean Levitus climatology
 saltClimFile    = 'SSS.labsea'

Forcing files are a 1979-1999 monthly climatology computed from the
NCEP reanalysis (see pkg/seaice/SEAICE_FFIELDS.h for units and signs)
  uwindFile      = 'u10m.labsea79'    # 10-m zonal wind
  vwindFile      = 'v10m.labsea79'    # 10-m meridional wind
  atempFile      = 'tair.labsea1979'  # 2-m air temperature
  aqhFile        = 'qa.labsea1979'    # 2-m specific humidity
  lwdownFile     = 'flo.labsea1979'   # downward longwave radiation
  swdownFile     = 'fsh.labsea1979'   # downward shortwave radiation
  precipFile     = 'prate.labsea1979' # precipitation
  evapFile       = 'evap.labsea1979'  # evaporation


Instructions for running default Experiment
===========================================

Compiling the code:
  cd verification/lab_sea/input
  ln -sf ../code/*.h .
  ../../../tools/genmake -makefile
  make depend
  make

Running the code:
  ./mitgcmuv >&! output.txt

There is comparison output in:
  diff output.txt ../results/output.txt | more

Example: Labrador Sea Region with Sea-Ice
=========================================

This example sets up a small (20x16x23) Labrador Sea experiment
coupled to a dynamic thermodynamic sea-ice model.
A brief description of the sea-ice model is in "seaice.ps".

The domain of integration spans 280E to 320E and 46N to 78N.
Horizontal grid spacing is 2 degrees.
The 23 vertical levels and the bathymetry file
  bathyFile      = 'bathy.labsea'
are obtained from the the 2-degree ECCO configuration.

Integration is initialized from annual-mean Levitus climatology
 hydrogThetaFile = 'LevCli_temp.labsea'
 hydrogSaltFile  = 'LevCli_salt.labsea'

Surface salinity relaxation is to the monthly mean Levitus climatology
 saltClimFile    = 'SSS.labsea'

Forcing files are a 1979-1999 monthly climatology computed from the
NCEP reanalysis (see pkg/seaice/SEAICE_FFIELDS.h for units and signs)
  uwindFile      = 'u10m.labsea79'    # 10-m zonal wind
  vwindFile      = 'v10m.labsea79'    # 10-m meridional wind
  atempFile      = 'tair.labsea1979'  # 2-m air temperature
  aqhFile        = 'qa.labsea1979'    # 2-m specific humidity
  lwdownFile     = 'flo.labsea1979'   # downward longwave radiation
  swdownFile     = 'fsh.labsea1979'   # downward shortwave radiation
  precipFile     = 'prate.labsea1979' # precipitation

The experiment uses pkg/gmredi, pkg/kpp, pkg/seaice, and pkg/exf.
The test is a 1-cpu, 10-hour integration.   Both the atmospheric
state and the open-water surface fluxes are provided by pkg/exf.


Using testscript to test sea-ice code
=====================================

Running the testscript experiment:
  cd MITgcm/verification
  ./testreport -t lab_sea
The default experiment is Experiment 8, below.
It uses pkg/gmredi, pkg/kpp, pkg/seaice, and pkg/exf.

Note that fairly large differences in accuracy occur across different
platforms.  For example, testscript comparisons between g77 (Linux)
and f77 (SGI) generated output gives:

                T           S           U           V
C D M    c        m  s        m  s        m  s        m  s

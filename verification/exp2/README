Example: "4x4 Steady Global Simulation"
=======================================

To apply the changes to the default configuration of MITgcmUV:
  cd bin
  ln -s ../verification/exp2/code/SIZE.h ../bin/
  ln -s ../verification/exp2/code/CPP_OPTIONS.h ../bin/
  ln -s ../verification/exp2/code/CPP_EEOPTIONS.h ../bin/
  ln -s ../verification/exp2/code/external_fields_* ../bin/

Configure and compile the code:
  cd ../bin
  ../tools/genmake -makefile
  make depend
  make

To run:
  cd ../exe
  cp ../verification/exp2/input/* .
  dmpirun -np 4 mitgcmuv  ( Digital )

There is comparison output in two directories:
 ../verification/exp2/results
 ../verification/exp2/results.oldcode

To obtain the "oldcode" numbers make the following changes
to the older code: 
CPP_OPTIONS.h must have
  #define OLD_ADV_BCS
  #define OLD_UV_GEOMETRY
calc_mom_rhs.F must have
  #undef  NO_LATERAL_SLIP
  #define NO_BOTTOM_SLIP

Comments:
The input data is real*4.

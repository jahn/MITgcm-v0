#ifndef CPP_OPTIONS_H
#define CPP_OPTIONS_H

#include "PACKAGES_CONFIG.h"

C CPP flags controlling particular source code features

C o Shortwave heating as extra term in external_forcing.F
C Note: this should be a run-time option
#undef SHORTWAVE_HEATING

C o Include/exclude phi_hyd calculation code
#define INCLUDE_PHIHYD_CALCULATION_CODE

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CONVECT
#define INCLUDE_CONVECT_CALL

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CALC_DIFFUSIVITY
#define INCLUDE_CALC_DIFFUSIVITY_CALL

C o Include/exclude Implicit vertical advection code
cph#define INCLUDE_IMPLVERTADV_CODE

C o Include/exclude AdamsBashforth-3rd-Order code
#undef ALLOW_ADAMSBASHFORTH_3

C o Include/exclude nonHydrostatic code
cph#define ALLOW_NONHYDROSTATIC

C o Include pressure loading code
#define ATMOSPHERIC_LOADING

C o Use "Exact Convervation" of fluid in Free-Surface formulation
C   so that d/dt(eta) is exactly equal to - Div.Transport
#define EXACT_CONSERV

C o Allow the use of Non-Linear Free-Surface formulation
C   this implies that surface thickness (hFactors) vary with time
#define NONLIN_FRSURF
cph(
#define DISABLE_RSTAR_CODE
#define ALLOW_3D_DIFFKR
C
#define DISABLE_SIGMA_CODE
cph)

C o ALLOW isotropic scaling of harmonic and bi-harmonic terms when
C   using an locally isotropic spherical grid with (dlambda) x (dphi*cos(phi))
C *only for use on a lat-lon grid*
C   Setting this flag here affects both momentum and tracer equation unless
C   it is set/unset again in other header fields (e.g., GAD_OPTIONS.h).
C   The definition of the flag is commented to avoid interference with
C   such other header files.
C   The preferred method is specifying a value for viscAhGrid or viscA4Grid
C   in data which is then automatically scaled by the grid size;
C   the old method of specifying viscAh/viscA4 and this flag is provided
C   for completeness only (and for use with the adjoint).
C#define ISOTROPIC_COS_SCALING

C o This flag selects the form of COSINE(lat) scaling of bi-harmonic term.
C *only for use on a lat-lon grid*
C   Has no effect if ISOTROPIC_COS_SCALING is undefined.
C   Has no effect on vector invariant momentum equations.
C   Setting this flag here affects both momentum and tracer equation unless
C   it is set/unset again in other header fields (e.g., GAD_OPTIONS.h).
C   The definition of the flag is commented to avoid interference with
C   such other header files.
C#define COSINEMETH_III

C o Use "OLD" UV discretisation near boundaries (*not* recommended)
C   Note - only works with  #undef NO_SLIP_LATERAL  in calc_mom_rhs.F
C          because the old code did not have no-slip BCs
#undef  OLD_ADV_BCS

C o Execution environment support options
#include "CPP_EEOPTIONS.h"

C o Include/exclude code specific to the ECCO/SEALION version.
C   AUTODIFF or EXF package.
C   Currently controled by a single header file
C   For this to work, PACKAGES_CONFIG.h needs to be included!
# include "ECCO_CPPOPTIONS.h"

#endif /* CPP_OPTIONS_H */

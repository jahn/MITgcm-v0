global ocean in pressure coordinate 
===================================

To apply the changes to the default configuration of MITgcmUV:
Configure and compile the code:
  cd verification/global_ocean_pressure/input
  ../../../tools/genmake -mods='../code'
  make depend
  make
To run the code:
  ./mitgcmuv

There is comparison output in directory:
 ../verification/global_ocean_pressure/results

Comments
o the set up is similar to that of global_ocean.90x40x15
o the code directory contains calc_phi_hyd.F, where the potential is computed
  according to the more natural finite volume discretization. Finite difference
  discretization is energy conserving, but the representation of the "fixed"
  surface (interface ocean-atmosphere) is less consistent.
o the code directory also contains dynamics.F which calls
  remove_mean_rl.F, a generic routine, to remove the mean from the
  diagnostic variable phiHydLow (sea surface height/gravity in pressure
  coordinates)
